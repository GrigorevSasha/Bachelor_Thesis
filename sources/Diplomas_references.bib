abstract = {We propose a realizable architecture using one-dimensional transmission line resonators to reach the strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics in superconducting electrical circuits. The vacuum Rabi frequency for the coupling of cavity photons to quantized excitations of an adjacent electrical circuit (qubit) can easily exceed the damping rates of both the cavity and the qubit. This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances. In addition it would allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for quantum communication.},

abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser. {\textcopyright} 1963.},

The resulting photon shot noise is mitigated using a dynamical decoupling protocol, resulting in {\$}T{\_}2\backslashapprox 85\backslash,\backslashmu{\$}s, approximately the {\$}2T{\_}1{\$} limit.

This emerging field of superconducting quantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum circuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this rapidly developing field.},

abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of {\$}T{\_}2{\$} times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy {\$}E{\_}J/E{\_}C{\$}. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with {\$}E{\_}J/E{\_}C{\$}, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

@article{DeGraaf2018,
abstract = {Superconductivity in metallic nanowires is strongly influenced by fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter 1 . Thermally activated phase slips (TAPS) are dominant 2 near the superconducting transition temperature, T c . Well below T c the phase of a homogeneous superconducting wire can slip by 2$\pi$ due to quantum tunnelling, a process analogous to Cooper-pair tun-nelling in Josephson junctions 3 . The notion of coherent phase slips in nanowires proposed by Mooij and Nazarov 4 was supported by experiments by Astafiev et al. 5 with wires made of nominally homo-geneous superconducting material. Such CQPS, carried by tun-nelling of magnetic fluxons across a superconducting wire, enable devices based on quantum interference effects, opening a route towards a wide range of quantum devices dual to those that can be implemented with Josephson junctions 4,6,7 . Quantum interference of Cooper pairs in flux-based supercon-ducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) was demonstrated soon after the discovery of the Josephson effect 8 and has since become a cornerstone of superconducting electronics. Another cor-nerstone is the locking of the phase across the Josephson junction to an external microwave field, resulting in Shapiro steps at quan-tized voltages 9 . This effect is used in high-frequency amplifiers and detectors, and as the basis for the quantum voltage standard, which today underpins the electronics industry 10 . The main motivation for studying CQPS and dual superconducting devices has so far been the promise of a robust quantum current standard based on so-called dual Shapiro steps 4,11–13 , complementary to the Josephson voltage standard. Although this particular goal has not yet been achieved, the experimental observation of CQPS in superconduct-ing nanowires 5 has advanced the understanding of one-dimensional superconductivity and coherence in disordered superconductors 14,15 to the level where dual superconducting electronics has now become a possibility. Conventional d.c. SQUIDs can be viewed as a specific imple-mentation of the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect 16 , where interference of the wavefunction of a moving charged particle occurs when it encircles a flux (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the Aharonov–Casher (AC) effect, where the interference of fluxon trajectories occurs around a static charge 17 , is dual to the AB effect. The AC effect has previously been observed in a variety of particle and solid-state systems 18–21 and in Josephson junction arrays 22–26 . Here we demonstrate the AC effect in a nominally continuous superconductor. Our device comprises two series CQPS junctions in which we achieve charge-controlled interference of fluxon tunnelling in a device exactly dual to the SQUID. We call this device the charge quantum interference device (CQUID). This coherent charge-sensitive interferometer demonstrates the potential of CQPS devices previously explored only through the approximate 4 self-duality of Josephson junction circuits 12,22,27–31 . Such arrays of Josephson junctions have been shown to be a challenging complementary route towards a quantum cur-rent standard based on quantum phase slips 32 . In the CQUID, schematically shown in Fig. 1b, flux coherently tunnels across two narrow constrictions in a superconducting wire that we conclude is continuous in the superconducting order parameter (see evidence in Supplementary Information). The two constrictions, of size {\~{}}30nm × 50 nm, are connected in series and made out of a continuous {\~{}}3.3-nm-thick NbN film. These con-strictions provide well-defined points with an increased phase slip amplitude 15},

abstract = {The electrical transport properties of ultrathin YBa₂Cu₃O(7-x) films have been modified using an electric double layer transistor configuration employing an ionic liquid. A clear evolution from superconductor to insulator was observed in nominally 7 unit-cell-thick films. Using a finite size scaling analysis, curves of resistance versus temperature, R(T), over the temperature range from 6 to 22 K were found to collapse onto a single scaling function, which suggests the presence of a quantum critical point. However, the scaling fails at the lowest temperatures indicating the possible presence of an additional phase between the superconducting and insulating regimes.},

abstract = {In this paper, single-molecule spectroscopy experiments based on continuous$\backslash$nlaser excitation are characterized through an open quantum system$\backslash$napproach. The evolution of the fluorophore system follows from an$\backslash$neffective Hamiltonian microscopic dynamic where its characteristic$\backslash$nparameters, i.e., its electric dipole, transition frequency, and$\backslash$nRabi frequency, as well as the quantization of the background electromagnetic$\backslash$nfield and their mutual interaction, are defined in an extended Hilbert$\backslash$nspace associated to the different configurational states of the local$\backslash$nnanoenvironment. After tracing out the electromagnetic field and$\backslash$nthe configurational states, the fluorophore density matrix is written$\backslash$nin terms of a Lindblad rate equation. Observables associated to the$\backslash$nscattered laser field, such as optical spectrum, intensity-intensity$\backslash$ncorrelation, and photon-counting statistics, are obtained from a$\backslash$nquantum-electrodynamic calculation also based on the effective microscopic$\backslash$ndynamic. In contrast with stochastic models, this approach allows$\backslash$none to describe in a unified way both the full quantum nature of$\backslash$nthe scattered laser field as well as the classical nature of the$\backslash$nenvironment fluctuations. By analyzing different processes such as$\backslash$nspectral diffusion, lifetime fluctuations, and light assisted processes,$\backslash$nwe exemplify the power of the present approach.},

abstract = {Remarkable progress towards realizing quantum computation has been achieved using natural and artificial atoms as qubits. This article presents a brief overview of the current status of different types of qubits. On the one hand, natural atoms (such as neutral atoms and ions) have long coherence times, and could be stored in large arrays, providing ideal "quantum memories". On the other hand, artificial atoms (such as superconducting circuits or semiconductor quantum dots) have the advantage of custom-designed features and could be used as "quantum processing units". Natural and artificial atoms can be coupled with each other and can also be interfaced with photons for long-distance communications. Hybrid devices made of natural/artificial atoms and photons may provide the next-generation design for quantum computers.},

abstract = {A small superconducting electrode (a single-Cooper-pair box) connected to a reservoir via a Josephson junction constitutes an artificial two-level system, in which two charge states that differ by 2e are coupled by tunneling of Cooper pairs. Despite its macroscopic nature involving a large number of electrons, the two-level system shows coherent superposition of the two charge states, and has been suggested as a candidate for a qubit, i.e. a basic component of a quantum computer. Here we report on time-domain observation of the coherent quantum-state evolution in the two-level system by applying a short voltage pulse that modifies the energies of the two levels nonadiabatically to control the coherent evolution. The resulting state was probed by a tunneling current through an additional probe junction. Our results demonstrate coherent operation and measurement of a quantum state of a single two-level system, i.e. a qubit, in a solid-state electronic device.},

@article{Magesan2015,
abstract = {High-fidelity measurements are important for the physical implementation of quantum information protocols. Current methods for classifying measurement trajectories in superconducting qubit systems produce fidelities that are systematically lower than those predicted by experimental parameters. Here, we place current classification methods within the framework of machine learning algorithms and improve on them by investigating more sophisticated ML approaches. We find that non-linear algorithms and clustering methods produce significantly higher assignment fidelities that help close the gap to the fidelity achievable under ideal noise conditions. Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of specific systematic errors. We find large clusters in the data associated with relaxation processes and show these are the main source of discrepancy between our experimental and achievable fidelities. These error diagnosis techniques help provide a concrete path forward to improve qubit measurements.},
